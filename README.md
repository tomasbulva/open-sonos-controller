# Open Sonos Controller
This is meant to be the first hackable sonos controller. Based on ingenious NodeGUI. It is a native Linux app (other platforms soon to be coming), yet written in react. It offers snappy performance and great developer experience. 

## What is it?
OSC is not meant to replace sonos app or even spotify. It's just a remote to your sonos. Primarily focused on a severely underserved Linux community.
